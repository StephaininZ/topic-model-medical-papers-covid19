# topic-model-medical-papers-covid19
<p> Topic Modeling is a technique to extract the hidden topics from large volumes of text through conducting Dimensionality Reduction, Unsupervised Learning, and Tagging on the given texts. This project uses the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to mine the topics in the COVID-19 medical research papers published after 2020.</p>
<p> Since the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on Decemeber 31st 2019, researchers are sparing no effort to investigate about this highly-contagious pandemic in order to find the ultimate cure for mankind. So far there has been over 150,000 related papers issued. The number of publications addressing COVID-19 vaccine peaked in January 2021, prior to their large-scale vaccine production. However, among the published hundreds of thousands of papers, papers related to vaccine account for only 6%.</p>

<p> The most mentioned words are `SARS`, `patients`, `infection`, `impact`, `treatment`, `effect` and so on, which are problem-solving-oriented, aiming to study the subject matter so as to cure mankind of the Novel coronavirus pandemic. The next question is what topic dimension are those papers focusing on, what areas have been studied thoroughly, and which topic needs the most attention? It motivates me to explore the COVID-19 literature papers through topic mining. Consequently, I would be able to gain insights on the current medical research landscape to better inform how our healthcare system, governments, industries can fight against COVID-19. </p>

<h2> Insights on policy and guidance </h2>

* Insufficient number of researches on vaccine development 
* Lack of novel approaches  
* Reality check: Threats from COVID-19 virus mutants 

<p> More sophisticated research, novel directions, and more drug risk evaluation approaches need to be conducted in the vaccine and therapeutics field so that more effective and safer drugs will come to mass-production sooner and the general public will be able to end the quarantine life and defeat the COVID-19 pandemic someday soon. </p>
<p> To speed up the research process, inter-sector collaboration and knowledge sharing should be encouraged. It would be of the best interest for all if the biomedical research community can coorporate with </p>

 - the pharmaceutical industry for sample drug making (used for experiments) 
 - the healthcare professionals for patient diagonistics data and human clinical trial 
 - the government to communicate the newest findings and interventions viable to the public, guide government in non-medical intervention, and more importantly, for research funding support.
<p> We are not alone in this fight, only when we join hands, share resources and information across sector, border, and continent, can we win this fight and hold hand in hand together someday in the near future. </p>
